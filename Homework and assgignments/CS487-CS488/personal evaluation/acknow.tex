\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\vspace{1.0in}
I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Mr. Lam Quang Vu
and Mr. Ho Ngoc Lam, whose expertise, understanding, and patience,
added considerably to my experience of working with real life software clients while still in undergraduate. They provided timely and
instructive comments and evaluation at every stage of this project,
allowing us to complete the SoLoMO project on schedule.
I would also like to thank my family for the support they provided me
through my entire life.
