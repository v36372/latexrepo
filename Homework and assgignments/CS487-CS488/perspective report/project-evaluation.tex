\section{Project significance}
The project also aims for higher trust from customers by using the system of brands, which post their own promotion information after being verified. This way, the customers not only get the information from their friends, their network, but also from the brands themselves. This project focus on location-based search to improve the user experience and be a better way to search for promotion from specific location. In the long run, the project can become a very effective tool for brands to improve marketing performance with low cost.
