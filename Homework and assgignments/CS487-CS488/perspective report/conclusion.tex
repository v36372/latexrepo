\chapter{Conclusion}
The working process with client in this project provides the team members with practical experience. At the end of this course, although our product is still far from perfect since the mobile application is not running very smoothly and efficiently, the team has created a really strong technical base with well-categorized and modular structure which is perfectly fit for future massive scales. The final product can handle a small to medium set of users (1k - 10k users). Although, these numbers are not really impressive comparing to other social network system, it is enough to validate the product market fit without putting too many effort in technical side. Thanks to the modular structure, we can replace all components individually, even the core of the system with faster technical stacks without worry about the compatibility of the new system in the next stage of the product.
